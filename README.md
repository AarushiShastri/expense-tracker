# expense-tracker
Simple Expense Tracker made using HTML, CSS and JavaScript (for practice)
Source: Build an Expense Tracker with HTML CSS and JavaScript
What I added:
  1. Improved Categorization
  Dynamic Category Management:
    Users can add new categories and delete existing ones.
    Both the expense form and filter dropdowns update automatically to reflect the current list of categories.

  2. Simple Data Visualization (Chart.js)
  Interactive Pie Chart:
    Added a pie chart using Chart.js to visually display spending by category.
    The chart updates whenever expenses or categories change.

  3. Basic Budgeting
  Set a Monthly Budget:
    Users can input a budget amount.
    The app shows a warning if the user is close to or exceeds their budget.

  4. Export Data as CSV
  Export Functionality:
    Added a button to export all expenses as a CSV file for easy sharing or backup.
